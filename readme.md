# libvoxelbot


This library contains several algorithms that are useful when building bots for Starcraft 2.

It contains a build order simulator, a build order optimizer, a combat simulator, influence maps, many useful predicates and unit data lookups.

## Combat Simulator

The combat simulator can simulate battles between units of all SC2 races.
It properly takes into account things like:

- Damage bonuses (e.g. Immortal bonus against armored units).
- Melee units take a longer time to reach the enemy.
- Not an infinite number of melee units can attack the same unit at the same time.
- Damage/armor bonuses due to upgrades.
- A few special cased upgrades like: Resonating Glaives, Charge, Extended Thermal Lance..
- Healing units like Medivacs and Shield Batteries as well as some shielding units like the Sentry.
- Melee units typically block enemy melee units from attacking the ranged units further back.
- The range of units is properly taken into account when the engagement starts. For example siege tanks can start to attack much earlier than roaches as tanks have a much higher range.
- Splash damage is approximated ok-ish.
- It assumes that units do decent target firing.

It does *not* take the following effects into account:

- Terrain effects like choke points and low/high ground.
- Unit positions. Many effects that relate to unit positions are approximated, but the exact values are not used.
- Bunkers and other cases where units can be inside another unit.
- Kiting.
- More advanced abilities like Psi Storm and many others.

The simulator is pretty fast. It can simulate on the order of tens of thousands of battles per second. The performance does of course depend on the number of units in the fight and how long the fight continues for.

### Simple example
```C++
initMappings();
CombatPredictor simulator;
simulator.init();
CombatState state = {{
    makeUnit(1, UNIT_TYPEID::TERRAN_MARINE),
    makeUnit(1, UNIT_TYPEID::TERRAN_MEDIVAC),
    makeUnit(1, UNIT_TYPEID::TERRAN_MARINE),

    makeUnit(2, UNIT_TYPEID::ZERG_ROACH),
    makeUnit(2, UNIT_TYPEID::ZERG_ROACH),
    makeUnit(2, UNIT_TYPEID::ZERG_ZERGLING),
}};
CombatResult outcome = simulator.predict_engage(state);
cout << outcome.state.toString() << endl;
cout << "Winner player is " << outcome.state.owner_with_best_outcome() << endl;
```

Output:

```
Owner Unit       Health
1     Marine       0/45
1     Medivac    150/150
1     Marine       0/45
2     Roach       58/145
2     Roach      145/145
2     Zergling     0/35

Winner player is 2
```

### More advanced example

This shows how upgrades can be specified and how to access the unit data in the outcome.

```C++
initMappings();
CombatPredictor simulator;
simulator.init();

CombatState state = {{
    makeUnit(1, UNIT_TYPEID::TERRAN_MARINE),
    makeUnit(1, UNIT_TYPEID::TERRAN_MEDIVAC),
    makeUnit(1, UNIT_TYPEID::TERRAN_MARINE),

    makeUnit(2, UNIT_TYPEID::ZERG_ROACH),
    makeUnit(2, UNIT_TYPEID::ZERG_ROACH),
    makeUnit(2, UNIT_TYPEID::ZERG_ZERGLING),
}};

CombatUpgrades player1upgrades = {
    UPGRADE_ID::TERRANINFANTRYWEAPONSLEVEL1,
    UPGRADE_ID::TERRANINFANTRYWEAPONSLEVEL2,
    UPGRADE_ID::TERRANINFANTRYWEAPONSLEVEL3,
    UPGRADE_ID::TERRANINFANTRYARMORSLEVEL1,
    UPGRADE_ID::TERRANINFANTRYARMORSLEVEL2,
};

CombatUpgrades player2upgrades = {
    UPGRADE_ID::ZERGMISSILEWEAPONSLEVEL1,
};

state.environment = &simulator.getCombatEnvironment(player1upgrades, player2upgrades);

CombatSettings settings;
// Simulate for at most 100 *game* seconds
// Just to show that it can be configured, in this case 100 game seconds is more than enough for the battle to finish.
settings.maxTime = 100;
CombatResult outcome = simulator.predict_engage(state, settings);
cout << outcome.state.toString() << endl;
for (auto& unit : outcome.state.units) {
    cout << getUnitData(unit.type).name << " ended up with " << unit.health << " hp" << endl;
}
cout << "Winner player is " << outcome.state.owner_with_best_outcome() << endl;
cout << "Battle concluded after " << outcome.time << " seconds" << endl;

## Build Order Optimizer

The build order optimizer can find a highly optimized build order for producing a given set of units.

- It can automatically build additional Nexuses/Hatcheries/Command Centers, workers and even Warpgate research if that speeds up the build order.
- It has support for chrono boost.
- It works for any built-in race, however Protoss is the one most heavily tested. Zerg and Terran may require some additional work.
- Takes on the order of half a second to run. The number of iterations can be lowered/increased to adjust the quality/time trade-off.
- Does not optimize for the absolutely shortest build order by default, but optimizes for a good economy as well.
- Can take both units and upgrades as requirements.
- 
### Simple example

This example shows how to generate a build order from a given starting state.

```C++
initMappings();

// Start with 1 nexus and 12 probes
BuildState state {{
    { UNIT_TYPEID::PROTOSS_NEXUS, 1 },
    { UNIT_TYPEID::PROTOSS_PROBE, 12 },
}};
// Start with 50 minerals
state.resources.minerals = 50;
state.resources.vespene = 0;
// Our Nexus has 50 energy at the start of the game
state.chronoInfo.addNexusWithEnergy(state.time, 50);

// Find a good build order for producing some units
BuildOrder buildOrder = findBestBuildOrderGenetic(state, {
    { BuildOrderItem(UNIT_TYPEID::PROTOSS_ZEALOT), 4 },
    { BuildOrderItem(UNIT_TYPEID::PROTOSS_STALKER), 4 },
    { BuildOrderItem(UNIT_TYPEID::PROTOSS_IMMORTAL), 2 },
    { BuildOrderItem(UPGRADE_ID::PROTOSSGROUNDARMORSLEVEL1), 1 },
});

// Print the build order
cout << buildOrder.toString() << endl;

// Print a more detailed build order output which includes timing information
cout << buildOrder.toString(state, BuildOrderPrintMode::Detailed);

If you have a SC2 observation instance you can construct a BuildState easily. It would be annoying to have to manually add everything.
This takes care of things like finding existing buildings, units and upgrades as well as buildings and units that are in progress.
It will also estimate the remaining number of mineral fields around each base.

```C++
// If you have a SC2 agent observation you can construct a build state easily
BuildResources resources(observation->GetMinerals(), observation->GetVespene());
float time = ticksToSeconds(observation->GetGameLoop());
BuildState state(observation, Unit::Alliance::Self, Race::Protoss, resources, time));
```

## Building

Requirements:
- C++14
- [s2client-api](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-api)
- [cereal](https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal)

This library assumes that you are including it together with a SC2 bot that already uses the [sc2client-api](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-api) and already builds it as part of your CMake file.

```bash
git clone --recursive <this repository>
```

In your CMakeLists.txt file add the following:

```CMake
add_subdirectory("libvoxelbot")
```

and make sure to link with `libvoxelbot`

```CMake
target_link_libraries(mybot PUBLIC libvoxelbot)
```
